## Chytirio

**Transforming Software Development Through Research-Driven Orchestration**

---

### 🚀 **What We're Building**

#### **Research-First Development**
Transform how you approach problems. Start with research, explore solutions deeply, and let AI agents handle the implementation details while you focus on what matters most.

#### **Multi-Repository Intelligence** 
Work naturally across your entire codebase ecosystem. Chytirio understands relationships between repositories and coordinates changes intelligently across project boundaries.

#### **AI Agent Collaboration**
Partner with specialized AI agents that understand your context, learn your patterns, and handle everything from research to implementation to coordination.

#### **Organizational Memory**
Build lasting institutional knowledge. Every research session and architectural decision becomes part of your team's growing intelligence.
